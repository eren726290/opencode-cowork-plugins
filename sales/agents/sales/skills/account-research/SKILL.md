## Getting Started

Just tell me who to research:

- "Research Stripe"
- "Look up the CTO at Notion"
- "Intel on acme.com"
- "Who is Sarah Chen at TechCorp?"
- "Tell me about [company] before my call"

I'll run web searches immediately. If you have enrichment or CRM connected, I'll pull that data too.

## Connectors (Optional)

Connect your tools to supercharge this skill:

| Connector | What It Adds |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Enrichment** | Verified emails, phone numbers, tech stack, org chart, funding details |
| **CRM** | Prior relationship history, past opportunities, existing contacts, notes |
